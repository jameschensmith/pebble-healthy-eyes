Healthy Eyes - The Smart Pomodoro Timer for Pebble
==================================================
Do you find yourself staring at screens for long periods of time, eventually leading to headaches? Or, are you working on a task, only to find yourself not making any progress? [Healthy Eyes](1) may be the solution for you!

Healthy Eyes is a [Pebble](2) watchapp that aims to help you manage your time and to keep track of your breaks while preventing [eyestrain](3). The technique used for the timer is similar to the [Pomodoro Technique](4), but with the flexibility of being able to snooze the timer in case you need another minute to jot down a spur-of-the-moment idea or catch the end-of-credits teaser of your favorite show.
