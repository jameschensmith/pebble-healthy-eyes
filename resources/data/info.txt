Healthy Eyes is a Pebble watchapp that aims to help you manage your time and to keep track of your breaks while preventing eyestrain. The technique used for the timer is similar to the Pomodoro Technique, but with the flexibility of being able to snooze the timer in case you need another minute to jot down a spur-of-the-moment idea or catch the end-of-credits teaser of your favorite show.
